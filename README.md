# ARM-recursive-fibonacci
This ARM assembly code implements a recursive Fibonacci function. It utilizes the ARM64 architecture and uses recursion to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers. 
The main function initializes a value, computes its Fibonacci using the _fib function, and then prints the result using printf. 
The Fibonacci function employs recursion, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, eventually computing and returning the Fibonacci number.

Note: This code assumes that there is a printf function available to handle the output. It's important to have the necessary libraries and configurations for successful execution.
